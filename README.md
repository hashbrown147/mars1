# mars1
this repository consists of the task 1 assigned by the mars club team for the software subsystem.
the light dose consists of the linux commands. As my laptop is not compatible for linux.
I actually did the task in the laboratories because of which i am submitting a jpeg file for it.
then for the medium dose programs. i tried to learn a little bit of c++,the first question was about some custom data variable and the second question was about classes and objects
the second question felt a bit like structures in c and wrote the class for the mars team and gave a sampple input for it.
i didn't understand the concept of intracommunication in the question so i couldn't complete it.
and in the third heavy dose I wrote a code that checks every number from 130000 which has 4 distinct prime factors.
but for the second program i coul dnot get the logic behind it because of which i coulf not write the code
