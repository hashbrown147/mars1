# mars1
this repository consists of the task 1 assigned by the mars club team for the software subsystem.
the light dose consists of the linux commands. As my laptop is not compatible for linux.
I actually did the task in the laboratories because of which i am submitting a jpeg file for it.
I used commands like mkdir for making a directory,gedit for opening a text editor,gcc to run the code,exe to execute, ls to list the files and cd to change the directory.

then for the medium dose programs. i tried to learn a little bit of c++,the first question was about some custom data variable and the second question was about classes and objects
the second question felt a bit like structures in c and wrote the class for the mars team and gave a sampple input for it.
I created a class for mars club members which consisted of the name,subsystem,role in the subsystem and the roll numbers of the members and made it public and a function call to print the statement 
I also gave a sample for the second question.
i didn't understand the concept of intracommunication in the question so i couldn't complete it.

and in the third heavy dose I wrote a code that checks every number from 130000 which has 4 distinct prime factors.
i gave the input from 130000 and created a array size four.
The code checks the divisibility of the number with every prime number less than that number and if it is divisible then it increments the array index i of that number 
After checking the divisibility of 4 consecutive numbers if all four are divisible by 4 distinct prime numbers then the array will contain 4,4,4,4.
if the array contaiins the above result then it prints the number and "Hello Mars!"

but for the second program i coul dnot get the logic behind it because of which i coulf not write the code
